0.41

0.39
 - Add Rmpq_integer_p(), though mpq_integer_p() is not currently implemented in gmp.
 - PREREQ_PM => {'Exporter' => '5.58'} to avoid test failures on pre perl-5.8.4
   (Thanks Peter Acklam.)

0.38
 - Tweaks to Math::GMPq::gmp_v() and Math::GMPq::V::gmp_v()
 - Add metadata to Makefile.PL.
 - No longer define USE_64_BIT_INT if ivtype is 'long'.
 - Rename USE_64_BIT_INT #define to MATH_GMPQ_NEED_LONG_LONG_INT.
 - Replace mpq_cmp() with the faster mpq_equal() in overload_equiv and overload_not_equiv.
 - Add mpq_cmp_z support. (Added in gmp-6.1.0.)
 - Modify overloaded comparison functions to cover comparison with mpz_t (gmp-6.0.99 and later only)

0.37
 - Alter wrap_gmp_sprintf and wrap_gmp_snprintf to take an extra arg (length of
   buffer to which we write).
 - Remove Rmpq_sprintf_ret and Rmpq_snprintf_ret. (These now seem pointless in
   view of the changes to wrap_gmp_sprintf and wrap_gmp_snprintf.)
 - Add Math::GMPq::__GNU_MP_RELEASE.
 - Alter V.xs to accommodate the possibility that the global constant gmp_version
   has not been set in gmp.h. I've assumed this can only happen if the gmp
   library version is earlier than 4.0.0. (The gmp ChangeLog indicates that this
   is so.)
 - No longer include inttypes.h on the basis of USE_LONG_DOUBLE being defined.
   (Was harmless ... but didn't make much sense.)
 - Define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT (in XS code).

0.36
 - Fix test 3i in new.t. (It wasn't allowing for the case where perl was built
   with long double support, but ivsize was still 4.
 - Alter the way that strEQ gets hold of HvNAME(SvSTASH(SvRV(sv))) - so that -Wall
    doesn't emit "null argument" warnings. (Thanks Daniel Kahn Gillmor.)

0.35
 - Add Math::GMPq::V
 - Add overload_inc and overload_dec functions.
 - Accommodate cross-class overloaded arithmetic with Math::MPFR.

0.33
 - Remove 'not' from overloads. Apparently achieved nothing anyway, and 5.16
   warns that it's invalid.

0.32
 - In the documentation, elaborate on the way that Math::GMPq::get_v() and
   __GNU_MP_VERSION & friends determine their values. (Thanks Vincent Lefevre.)

0.31
 - Fix Random.xs so that it compiles with gmp-4 (not just gmp-5).
   Thanks Rob Kuo (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=58501)

0.29
 - Add random functions.
 - Add Rmpq_snprintf and Rmpq_snprintf_ret.
 - If there's no variable to be formatted, Rmpq_(f/s)printf no longer
   need to be supplied with a dummy variable.
 - Some buggy tests in printf.t hopefully fixed.

0.28
 Requires gmp-4.2.0 or later.
 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46499:
 - Amendment to Makefile.PL wrt 'long long' and 'long double' support.
 - Remove reliance on $Config{use64bitint} in t/new.t and t/out_str.t
 - Add some MAC OS X notes to README and fix some typos.

 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46604
 - Fix ___GMP__CC() and ___GMP_CFLAGS() so that they return undef
   if __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS are not defined by the gmp library.

 Thanks, Bob Kuo and Jonathan Leto.

0.27
 - Requires gmp-4.2.3 0r later.
 - Add Rmpq_fprintf, Rmpq_sprintf and Rmpq_sprintf_ret.
 - Change Rmpq_sprintf to return the number of characters written.
 - Add __GNU_MP_VERSION, __GNU_MP_VERSION_MINOR, __GNU_MP_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL,
   __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS
 - Change Rmpq_printf() so that, like its fprintf and sprintf counterparts,
   it formats only one variable at a time.

0.24
 - Replace the PerlIO* objects stuff in _TRmpfr_* functions (added in
   0.23) with FILE* objects  ... so that the module will still build
   on perl 5.6.

0.23
 - Add TRmpq_out_str and TRmpq_inp_str.
 - Rmpq_out_str now takes an optional (leading) string argument - a
   string that will be prepended to the mpq_out_str() output.
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler and GMP library.

0.11
 - Add overloaded int() function
 - Rewrite new()
 - Rmpq_out_str() now takes an optional third argument - a string
   that will be appended to the mpq_out_str() output. Also stdout is
   fflush()'d each time Rmpq_out_str() is called.
 - The overload functions and new() can now handle a long double value
   correctly

0.10
 - First CPAN release
 - No longer assign Exporter and DynaLoader to @Math::GMPq::ISA.
 - Add support for perls built with use64bitint
 - add new() function/method to facilitate initialization/assignment
